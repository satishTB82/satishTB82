You can remove elements from a many2many field on a few ways. You can either delete a specific record and the relation if you know it:

(2, ID) remove and delete the linked record with id = ID (calls unlink on ID, that will delete the object completely, and the link to it as well)
Or you can only delete the link to the remote record:

(3, ID) cut the link to the linked record with id = ID (delete the relationship between the two objects but does not delete the target object itself)
Or if you want to unlink all records (without deleting the remote record) on a many2many directly you can do it like this:

(5) unlink all (like using (3,ID) for all linked records)
Or if you want to delete all records:

(6, 0, []) replace the list of linked IDs (like using (5) then (4,ID) for each ID in the list of IDs)
because we use [] it'll drop all records.
